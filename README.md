# Programming-II

Assignment Brief:

Create an Android App using the Kotlin programming language, which makes use of a public web API to provide information to the user of the app. If you are being reassessed, you must choose a different API to the one(s) used in any previous submission(s).

You should choose the public API for yourself, but it must meet the following requirement: • The primary documentation page(s) for the API must have been archived at least once on archive.org

Note: It is possible to archive a web page on archive.org manually (when it hasn’t been archived before). If you do this, ensure you check the archived version includes the appropriate information You may use a networking library (such as Volley) for making network requests, however you should ensure that there is a significant amount of your own original code in the submission. Projects that are overly reliant on third party code/packages risk not attracting enough marks to pass.

At its most trivial the application might simply retrieve a single piece of information (such as a joke). The user should be able to specify when a request is made (for example by pressing a button), as well as selecting some option which affects the call made to the API, (for example by choosing a category for a joke using a Spinner control). The user should not, however, be required to type a parameter. You should choose your own original idea, but examples of the sort of project that could meet the pass criteria would include consuming and API which would allow the user to

• Select a currency unit and find the value of £1 in that currency • Select from a choice of words and view synonyms / definitions of that word • Select a location and view a weather report for that location

You may find the list of free public APIs at https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis useful in selecting a topic.

A more complex example could make use of features available in Android, such as location services, to retrieve more complex data. An example app could make use of the UK Police API to provide location specific crime data to the user.

You must not use a tutorial to undertake this assignment, and using APIs specified in the course tutorials and lecture demos (included, but not limited to, the Ron Swanson quotes API and the Chuck Norris jokes API) is specifically prohibited.

Your application should be tested to work on the Pixel 4 AVD using API 33.
